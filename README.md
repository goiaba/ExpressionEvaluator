A simple expression evaluator in Scala using
[parboiled2](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2) for parsing.

The goal is an understanding of:

- the compilation tool chain
- lexical analysis (tokenization)
- syntax analysis (parsing)
- regular expressions
- syntax analysis (parsing)
- EBNF
- parsing expression grammars (PEGs)
- interpreter pattern
- structured operational semantics
- domain models as algebraic data types and the pertinent Scala idiom
- structural recursion for defining behaviors for these domain models
- parboiled2 PEG parser generator
